The CCX and CCXR both had supercharged engines, which at the time was the superior solution. However, turbo technology had come a long way and the downside of turbo lag was starting to become almost nonexistent, if engineered properly. The problem with turbo engines, high power and emission control was that the catalytic converters caused a lot of back pressure at high power levels. These back pressures were elevated through the turbo and into the exhaust ports of the engine, thereby causing what is called hot EGR. Hot EGR is a source for detonation knocking. To alleviate this problem, Christian came up with an ingenious solution by placing the pre-cat behind the waste gate instead of the turbo, thereby reducing the back pressure with a factor of 3. This simple solution gave 300 hp extra power and was a worthy successor of the Rocket cat invented and developed by Christian almost 10 years earlier. It also meant that the Agera could deliver torque, power and response to match much larger engines at a fraction of their weight, making it extremely csompetitive.
